<p>Day 1: Lima, Peru</p>
</div>
<div class="Limabody">
<p>Catch a direct flight into Lima and let the sight-seeing begin. Check out the Aliaga House, the oldest house in the Americas, or Government Palace, the official residence and office of Peru's president. This adorable couple is standing outside the Church of San Francisco - one of the best preserved colonial Catholic churches in the city. Don't forget your camera!</p>

Days 2-3: Sacred Valley, Peru
</div>
<div class="Sacredbody">
<p>From Lima, hop on a bus to the city of Cuzco located in the Sacred Valley, so named for its fertility and the spiritual qualities that the Inca civilization - which dominated the region between the early 13th and late 16th centuries - attributed to it. Various ancient sites include the Salineras Pre-Inca Salt Mines, used to produce salt to this day, and Moray, terraced circular depressions whose depth and orientation with respect to wind and sun create a temperature difference of as much as 15 degrees celcius (27 degrees fahrenheit) between the top and bottom. This large temperature difference was possibly used by the Inca to study the effects of different climatic conditions on crops.</p>

<div class="Ollyantambotitle">
Day 4: Ollantaytambo, Peru
</div>
<div class="Ollyantambobody">
<p>Conveniently located in the Sacred Valley, the town and Inca archaeological site of Ollantaytambo warrants a day-long visit all its own. During the reign of the Inca Empire, Ollantaytambo was the royal estate of Emperor Pachacuti who conquered the region, built the town and a ceremonial center. At the time of the Spanish conquest of Peru it served as a stronghold for Manco Inca Yupanqui, leader of the Inca resistance. Nowadays, it is an important tourist attraction on account of its well-preserved Inca buildings.</p>

<div class="Machutitle">
Days 5-6: Machu Picchu, Peru
</div>
<div class="Machubody">
<p>Perhaps the most familiar icon of Inca civilization is Machu Picchu. Located on a mountain ridge above the Sacred Valley, the 15th-century Inca site was unknown to the world beyond its local environment before being brought to international attention in 1911. Since the site was not known to the Spanish during their conquest, it is highly significant as a relatively intact cultural site and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.</p>

<div class="Quitotitle">
Day 7: Quito, Ecuador
</div>
<div class="Quitobody">
<p>From Peru, catch a flight to Quito, the capital city of neighboring Ecuador. The old town of Quito is one of the largest, least-altered and best-preserved historic centers in the Americas. It was one the first World Cultural Heritage Sites declared by UNESCO in 1978. Be certain to see the Plaza and Monastery of San Francisco (the city's largest colonial structure), the Plaza de la Independencia (Plaza Grande), and La Compania de Jesus (Ecuador's most ornate church).</p>

<div class="Equatortitle">
Day 8: Equator, Ecuador
</div>
<div class="Equatorbody">
<p>From Quito, drive the easy 25 km north to the equator. A monument and museum marking the general location of the equator is known locally as la mitad del mundo (the middle of the world), to avoid confusion, as the word Ecuador is Spanish for equator. The egg balancing on a nail seen here is one of a series of activities made more easy by the magnetic forces at work at the center of the earth. However, while it is easier to balance an egg at the equator, it is harder for a person to maintain his or her balance.</p>

<div class="Guayaquiltitle">
Day 9: Guayaquil, Ecuador
</div>
<div class="Guayaquilbody">
<p>From Quito, take a five hour bus ride to Guayaquil, the largest and most populous city in Ecuador. Sites to see include Parque Historico, where you'll find restored century-old buildings in a newly built park, and endless shopping! Check out the El Mercado Artesanal Loja, a large artisans' market that carries a huge variety of crafts from all over Ecuador, and La Bahia, a crowded maze of vendors selling everything from knock-off name-brand watches to brassieres and bootleg CDs.</p>

Days 10-11: Isabela Island, Ecuador
</div>
<div class="Isabelabody">
<p>From Guayaquil, hop a plane to Santa Cruz, the most populated urban center of the Galapagos Islands. Rent a boat and tour Isabela Island, the largest of the Galapagos, which has extremely rich animal, bird, and marine life. It is home to wild tortoises, penguins, marine iguanas, pelicans and Sally Lightfoot crabs (seen here). Galapagos Land Iguanas roam the island's interesting lowland vegetation. The west coast of Isabela in the Bolivar Channel is the best place in Galapagos for viewing whales and dolphins.</p>

Day 12: Bartholomew Island, Ecuador
</div>
<div class="Bartholomewbody">
<p>Take a boat to Bartholomew Island, one of the youngest of the Galapagos Islands. Bartholomew consists of an extinct volcano and is famous for its Pinnacle Rock, the most distinctive and representative landmark of the Galapagos. The underwater world here is really impressive; it includes penguins, marine turtles, white-tipped reef sharks, and other tropical fish. A snorkeling session comes highly recommended!</p>

<div class="Genovesatitle">
Day 13: Genovesa Island, Ecuador
</div>
<div class="Genovesabody">
<p>A shield volcano in the Galapagos Islands, Genovesa Island is known as Bird Island because of the large and varied bird colonies that nest here. After boating here and walking up a steep path that leads up to cliffs that are 25m high, visitors stroll through a seabird colony full of life. There is an abundance of frigatebirds and it is among the best place in the archipelago to see Red-footed Boobies, Nazca Boobies, Swallow-tailed Gulls, storm petrels, tropic birds, Darwin's finches, and Galapagos Mockingbirds.</p>

</div>
<div class="ending">
This plan leaves Day 14 for you to fly back to Guayaquil from Santa Cruz, and from Guayaquil back to the States. Yes, I have thought of everything.
